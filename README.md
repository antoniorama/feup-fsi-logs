# Computer Security Foundations - LogBooks

In this repository, you'll find a detailed record of my journey through the Computer Security Foundations curricular unit, where I completed a SeedLabs' Lab and a CTF challenge each week. The logbooks inside provide a clear view of the progress, challenges, and solutions. It's a practical look at the work I've done, offering insights and reflections on each task.

With these challenges I learned foundations about the following security topics: 
- Environment Variable and Set-UID Vulnerabilities
- Buffer-Overflow Attacks
- Format-String Vulnerability
- SQL Injection
- Secret Key Encryption
- PKI
- Sniffing and Spoofing Packets
